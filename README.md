# sfg-shiny-workshop
This repo includes materials for a 1-hour SFG shiny workshop which highlights some of the neat new things in Shiny from the 2018 R Studio conference. Included is a presentation with workshop materials, helpful slide excerpts, neat new packages, etc, and also several demo apps which highlight some of the new features. The demo apps sequentially build on each other to create more complicated apps.

You can view the presentation [here](https://rawgit.com/gmcdonald-sfg/sfg-shiny-workshop/master/shiny_march_2018.html).
